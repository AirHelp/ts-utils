# ts-utils-starter-react

### Yet another React + TypeScript boilerplate ðŸ˜±

> There are other React.js (and often TypeScript) boilerplates on the Internet[[1]](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit)[[2]](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter)[[3]](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate), not to mention [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Why bother with this one?

We already have multiple React.js applications at AirHelp created and maintained by different people. Also, more and more often we see React.js to be picked by teams new to JS who feel that they came to a dead end with _jQuery driven UIs_.

With `ts-utils-started-react` we would like to gather best practices, patterns and tools evaluated and learnt by teams working with React.js in a single place. So, even if you pick `create-react-app` as a foundation for your next project, we will try to make `ts-utils-started-react` your go-to place when looking for the answers on more specific implementation problems.
